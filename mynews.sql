But some of the characters recently getting attention and lighting up social media have names like Sharon Carter, Jimmy Woo and the Dora Milaje.', 'marvel.jpg', 'When \"Captain America: The First Avenger\" and \"Thor\" hit theaters a decade ago, the contours of Marvel\'s plans for a cinematic universe -- building toward the \"Avengers\" -- took shape. Yet even for those weaned on the comics, the latest phase of Marvel\'s expansion has been notably defined by the depth of its bench, and the remarkable mileage extracted from less-familiar characters.\r\nThe marquee heroes used to launch Marvel onto streaming service Disney+ have been Wanda and the Vision, and the Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Those two projects, however, have been enriched by deftly incorporating peripheral players, eliciting enthusiastic responses from fans.\r\nWakandan bodyguards the Dora Milaje? Quicksilver? SHIELD agent Sharon Carter, astrophysicist Darcy Lewis, and FBI agent Jimmy Woo? Those personalities and others have cropped up in the Disney+ shows, reflecting the breadth of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and underscoring the seamless way Marvel has mixed and matched talent in building its interlocking titles.\r\nIf Marvel has made this look organic, even easy, it wasn\'t always thus. Indeed, while one could envision the big-screen possibilities for properties like Spider-Man and X-Men (produced, incidentally, through other studios after Marvel Comics sold off the rights), the further producers reached into the grab bag, the more tenuous the commercial prospects always appeared to become.\r\nFrom that perspective, the most important movie in building the current Marvel mystique in hindsight might have been \"Guardians of the Galaxy,\" conjuring a major hit out of the spacefaring team of misfits in 2014. If Marvel fans were ready to buy a talking raccoon and tree, the sky -- or rather, universe -- really was the limit.\r\nMarvel followed that the next year with \"Ant-Man,\" which turned the one-time \"Saturday Night Live\" punchline into an unlikely success; and then demonstrated just how many heroes could be crammed into one movie with \"Captain America: Civil War,\" which featured a battle involving a dozen characters and, among other things, introduced Black Panther before his solo movie in 2018.\r\nFor those weaned on the signature comics created by Stan Lee with artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko in the 1960s, the depth and breadth of Marvel\'s current appeal is beyond anything they could have reasonably expected, especially after some of the clunky adaptations from its early days. That\'s especially true since the Marvel/Disney tandem has yet to put its imprint on the title that started it all, Fantastic Four, after underwhelming attempts under the cinematic stewardship of Fox.\r\nMarvel has approached its first Disney+ shows with the same sense of interconnectedness that has powered its roster of movies, which brought everyone together in spectacular fashion with \"Avengers: Endgame.\" That film also marked the exit of two signature characters, Iron Man and Captain America, leaving some very sizable shoes to fill, with the latter\'s legacy providing the essence of the latest series.\r\nWhile streaming occupies a different space than theatrical movie-going, \"WandaVision\" and \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\" have already demonstrated the advantages of using Disney+ as a lab to develop and explore characters that might not be ready for a $200-million blockbuster.\r\nWith the planned next phase of movies delayed during the pandemic, the immediate road map as those films roll out is pretty clear. The lineup includes \"Black Widow,\" a number of eagerly anticipated sequels and another big bet in \"The Eternals.\"\r\nStill, the way Marvel has deployed its troops in these first shows for Disney+ has flexed the company\'s muscles in unexpected ways, opening the doors, appropriately, to whole new worlds of possibilities.', 'Brian Lowry', '2021-04-16 09:47:52'),

He moved seamlessly from formal navy uniform and black-tie attire to laid-back outfits better suited to family shooting weekends at Balmoral castle in Scotland.\r\nHis gentlemanly approach to fashion meant that over 73 years of his marriage to Queen Elizabeth II, his ensembles complemented but never overshadowed her.\r\nTo Dylan Jones, editor-In-chief of GQ and menswear chairman of the British Fashion Council, the duke was a \"true sartorial connoisseur\" who \"always dressed according to the rules.\"\r\n\"He had dignity, style and decorum,\" Jones wrote via email.\r\nThroughout his life Prince Philip would call on the services of many of the established and palace-approved ateliers on London\'s Savile Row. Perfectly cut suits, often fitted by his longtime tailor John Kent, were of course a staple in his wardrobe. His robemaker was London\'s oldest tailor, Ede & Ravenscroft, which was established in 1689, while Davies & Son handled his military attire and Gieves & Hawkes his naval dress. For kilts, the Prince Philip regularly enlisted the services of Kinloch Anderson in Edinburgh.\r\nWhile his impeccable standards are what defined his style, older photos of a young Philip show he wasn\'t afraid to have fun with his sartorial choices.\r\nMost British men in the 1940s preferred a clean-shaven look, but a candid portrait taken during a naval visit to Australia in 1945 reveals a bearded Philip in his mid-20s, smiling mischievously into the camera. Six years later, while on a royal tour in Canada, the duke danced at a traditional hoedown in blue jeans, a plaid shirt and a neckerchief to complete the look.\r\nA fan of cricket, polo and various water sports, he was often spotted in sportswear. A black-and-white photo taken in Turkey in 1951 during a summer cruise with the Royal Navy shows a svelte Prince Philip jumping off a set of water skis onto dry land, one of many action shots snapped of the handsome royal throughout his younger years.\r\nPrince Philip\'s preferred color palette was mostly muted, but his outfit for his 25th wedding anniversary with the Queen offered a rare splash of color. Their silver wedding celebrations took place in 1972 aboard the Royal Yacht Britannia, and in one photograph, the smiling couple are in visible holiday-mode, sunglasses and all. The Queen is pictured smiling brightly at her husband who is dressed in a boldly printed blue short-sleeved shirt and chinos.\r\nAs the longest serving consort in British history, Prince Philip was dutiful in life and style and will be remembered for his astute choices and his ability to use fashion to honor the spirit of almost any moment.\r\nHe was recognized for that ability in 2016, when he made it onto GQ\'s \"50 Best-Dressed Men in Britain\" list at the age of 94. Coming in at number 12, he even outranked his grandson Prince Harry who was placed 38th.\r\nWhen asked what secured the duke\'s spot high on the list, Jones said, \"His attention to detail and for always dressing like a gentleman. He had an innate gift for always looking appropriate.\"', 'Fiona Sinclair Scott', '2021-04-16 09:54:51'),

While he wanted to avoid escalating tensions, Biden made clear that he will not hesitate to take further action in the future.\r\n\"We cannot allow a foreign power to interfere in our democratic process with impunity,\" Biden said.\r\nHe added, \"I told (Putin) that we would shortly be responding in a measured and proportionate way because we had concluded that they had interfered in the election and SolarWinds was ... totally inappropriate.\"\r\nThe administration announced earlier Thursday that it was hitting Russia with sweeping sanctions and diplomatic expulsions, punishing Moscow for its interference in the 2020 US election, its SolarWinds cyberattack and its ongoing occupation and \"severe human rights abuses\" in Crimea.\r\nThe President said the US \"is not looking to kick off a cycle of escalation and conflict in Russia. We want a stable, predictable relationship,\" before sending a warning: \"If Russia continues to interfere with our democracy, we\'re prepared to take further actions to respond.\"\r\nBiden did offer an olive branch, referencing the summit he has proposed with the Russian leader that he hopes will take place later on this summer in Europe.\r\n\"Now is the time to de-escalate,\" he said. \"The way forward is through thoughtful dialogue and diplomatic process.\"\r\nAs part of Thursday\'s announcement, the US formally named the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service as the force behind the SolarWinds hack that affected the federal government and wide swaths of the private sector. The White House also said that it is expelling 10 Russian diplomats from Washington, including \"representatives of Russian intelligence services,\" for the cyber hack and the election meddling.\r\nThe Biden administration is barring US financial institutions from participating in the primary market for bonds issued by Russia\'s central bank and other leading financial institutions. The US is also sanctioning six Russian tech companies that support the Russian intelligence services\' cyber program, as well as 32 entities and individuals for carrying out \"Russian government-directed attempts to influence the 2020 US presidential election,\" the administration said in a fact sheet. Another eight individuals and entities are being sanctioned for \"Russia\'s ongoing occupation and repression in Crimea.\"\r\nIt\'s not clear how much the Biden administration\'s moves will change Putin\'s behavior. Biden did not directly answer whether the Russian president gave him any indication that he was willing to change, but told CNN\'s Phil Mattingly that he urged Putin \"to respond appropriately.\"\r\n\"We indicated we would talk about it,\" Biden said in response to Mattingly\'s question on Putin\'s attitude.\r\n\"I urged him to respond appropriately, not to exceed it because we can move as well. My hope and expectation is we\'ll be able to work out modus vivendi but it\'s important that we have direct talks and we continue to be in contact with one another,\" Biden added.\r\nThe President emphasized that there are places where the US and Russia can work together. He cited the New START treaty between the two nations and work \"reining in nuclear threats from Iran and North Korea, ending this pandemic globally and meeting the existential crisis of climate change.\"\r\n\"It is in the interest of the United States to work with Russia -- we should, and we will. When Russia seeks to violate the interests of the United States we will respond. We\'ll always stand in defense of our country, our institutions, our people and our allies,\" Biden said.\r\nThe White House has also addressed the omission of sanctions against Russia for other issues.\r\nBiden said during his remarks on Thursday that the issue of Nord Stream 2 -- a natural gas pipeline between Russia and Germany -- is still \"at play.\" And earlier Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the Biden administration feels \"there are questions to be answered by the Russian government\" about Russia allegedly placing bounties on US service members in Afghanistan.\r\nAhead of the potential summer summit, Biden may take part in meetings with Putin next week. The Russian president is among the dozens of world leaders invited to a virtual summit on climate change hosted by the White House.\r\nRussia\'s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) dismissed the US intelligence determination that it was responsible for the SolarWinds hack, Russian state news agency TASS reported Thursday.\r\nA statement released ahead of Biden\'s remarks was signed by the SVR\'s head of press and was titled \"Cinema and that\'s it\" -- a nod to the fact the SVR considers the US intelligence assessment a work of fiction. TASS reported the SVR considers the US\'s determination \"far-fetched\" and \"nonsense.\"', 'Donald Judd, Nicole Gaouette and Allie Malloy', '2021-04-16 09:59:36'),

But what are you talking about?\'\"\r\nMcConaughey is a well-known football fan, American football that is.\r\nHe\'s talked passionately about his love for the Washington Football Team in the NFL and he\'s often been seen on the sideline of the Texas Longhorns, his alma mater college team in his native Austin.\r\n\"I did play 12 years of soccer as a youth,\" he said, explaining his love for both sports. \"I went to a Tampa Bay Rowdies camp one summer. I was never that good. I did lead the league in red cards, but that\'s a longer story! So, I had interest, but it wasn\'t my game as it wasn\'t the quintessential American game back then.\"\r\n\'It\'s the great peacemaker\'\r\nThat all changed when he met his Brazilian wife, Camila Alves\r\n\"You find the woman of your life and she\'s from Brazil. Woo-hoo! You better get to know this other football brand, Mr. McConaughey!\"\r\nHe describes his marriage to a supporter of the five-time World Cup winners as akin to having \"soccer injected into my blood\' adding that their three children have now made his passion of the game even stronger.\r\n\"As we travel the world, we have found and love the game of soccer, because it\'s the one game they can play wherever: in the city, in the country, from New York to Timbuktu.\"\r\nHe casts a glance outside of the window to his yard and chuckles: \"I\'ve got two goals and I can see nine soccer balls, and there\'s my son trying to do reverse kicks into the goal, with himself!\"\r\nMcConaughey\'s work has taken him all over the world and his travels have shown him soccer\'s global appeal.\r\n\"Reykjavik, Cape Town, Cleveland, New York, Malibu, Warsaw. There\'s a soccer ball there. You can go up to anyone. You do not have to introduce yourself or even say your name. Just put a foot out and the ball comes to you. It\'s the great peacemaker. I call the soccer ball the greatest invitation in the world.\"\r\nThis year, the liberal, artsy, multicultural city of Austin will join the global conversation.\r\nThe Texas state capital has never before been home to a major-league professional sports team, and the demand for season tickets has rapidly outstripped supply --15,500 have already been sold, with another 14,000 fans on the waiting list.\r\nMcConaughey isn\'t just a part-owner of his hometown club; he\'s also its Minister of Culture, surely a unique title in the world of professional sports.\r\nInterlocking his fingers to make the point, McConaughey explains the diverse nature of the city and how he hopes their arrival as the 27th MLS team could change the face of the game in North America.\r\n\"Austin already had a fever for the game of soccer. I would argue that the snapshot of Austin FC may represent the international game -- look and feel, culture, fan experience -- it has the chance to represent that more than any other team in MLS.\"\r\nHe talks optimistically about the continued growth of the game in the US, which will host the 2026 World Cup along with Canada and Mexico, and which is increasingly exporting talent overseas.\r\n\"We are now finally starting to develop products on the pitch that match the fever that we have had in the stands. We\'re not at the international level yet, but we\'re on our way.\r\n\"When it\'s become the first-choice sport of the youth ... it\'s becoming ingrained in our culture.\"\r\nHe adds that if soccer isn\'t \"the new sport in America, it\'s \"the sport in the new America.\"\r\nFor a man who\'s made a very successful career out of scripted storytelling, McConaughey finds the attraction of sport\'s spontaneous narratives irresistible.\r\n\"It writes itself, live, in real time. And that\'s the beauty of sport. That\'s why we watch, because you don\'t know!\"\r\nHe could be talking about Austin FC\'s first game of the new season against LAFC on Saturday, his beloved Longhorns or even something much closer to home.\r\n\"My son\'s little league [baseball] or junior soccer game on a Saturday morning that turns out to be an epic battle, it was 8-7 at the end. And I just thought I was coming to a junior soccer match!\"\r\nAsked to compare the two forms of entertainment with which he\'s so familiar, he concludes that sport is winner. \"The prescribed script of how it will go down is already in second place, because it wasn\'t live.\"\r\nMcConaughey is entering the world of professional sport at a moment in history when it has become increasingly politicized, and also at a time when he is considering taking a step into politics and running for governor in Texas.\r\n\"You\'re not defined by being an athlete. It would be like somebody saying: \'Matthew, you shouldn\'t consider anything political because you\'re an actor and a storyteller.\'\"\r\nAthletes like McConaughey\'s friend, the Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton, uses his platform to campaign for social justice and racial equality; so, too, do stars such as the NBA\'s LeBron James and the four-time tennis major champion Naomi Osaka.\r\nIn 2019, MLS named Alejandro Bedoya the Player of the Week after he grabbed a pitch-side microphone and screamed: \"Congress, end gun violence now!\"\r\nMeanwhile as corporate America begins staking out a position on dozens of states\' efforts to suppress the vote, Major League Baseball recently withdrew its All-Star game from the state of Georgia.\r\n\"Is there a line?\" wonders McConaughey. \"I don\'t know that there\'s a line. I would just say if you want to boycott or move out or protest, know your reasons, develop them and evolve those reasons along the way. Nobody is bound by their vocation to be excluded from having a political view.\"\r\nUnfortunately, the pervasive nature of social media in modern society means that anybody\'s opinion can now be thrust directly into your feed, and many athletes have recently borne the brunt of some very toxic and even racist abuse.\r\n\"We, as humanity, as people, we\'ve got to get a handle on this,\" reflects McConaughey. \"Our youth doesn\'t know, so many adults don\'t even understand, that what you\'re putting down is going to outlive you.\r\n\"It\'s part of your resumé, of who you are for the rest of your life and after you\'re gone!\"\r\nSo how would he react if any Austin player finds himself on the receiving end of such abuse?\r\nHe says that it would be important to emphasize that the abuse isn\'t necessarily personal.\r\n\"A lot of times, that person is just spitting off. That person\'s got their own problem; that\'s the first thing I\'d say to a player. Don\'t let their dirty laundry make you dirty. Don\'t take it personally, even if it feels personal to you.\"\r\nPerhaps he\'d even recommend trying to find the abuser, to educate them face-to-face.\r\n\"Sport is a great example of anti-racism, a great example of people coming together and actually shining a light on differences. Let\'s go sit down and have the discussion, not on social media where he or she can hide.\"\r\nFor all of his accomplishments, McConaughey has said that the one thing that he always wanted to be was a father. In his autobiography \"Greenlights,\" he says he knew that when he was just eight years old.\r\nHis three children come up often during the conversation in this interview and it\'s clear that sport plays a big part in their relationship.\r\nMany parents will identify with the early starts every weekend to get their offspring to games and tournaments.\r\n\"You just trespassed on your mom and dad\'s Friday night, buddy!\" he quips about waking up to travel to a 7 a.m. match, but quickly stresses the shared life lessons are worth it.\r\n\"As a dad, it\'s almost a greater day to talk to your son after the heartbreaking loss than it is to talk about the championship. \'Did you give it your full effort? You\'re going to find resistance in this world, people wanting what you have. You\'re going to have to work with others to get what you want.\'\"\r\nNow that Austin FC is up and running, his weekends are going to be even more full of it.

It said it is considering options for legal action against these companies.\r\nClientEarth commissioned investigative media outlet DeSmog to research advertising by major oil companies. It then compared claims made in ads to information published in annual reports, regulatory filings and on company websites.\r\nThe non-profit contends that firms make claims of \"sustainability\" while investing far more into fossil fuel exploration than into clean energy investments.\r\nCompanies claim to be addressing the climate crisis while in some cases increasing fossil fuel production or planning to rely on the large-scale use of carbon capture and \"offsets,\" instead of reducing emissions in absolute terms, ClientEarth added.\r\nChevron, Shell and Equinor told CNN Business that their emissions reductions targets are in line with the goals of the Paris agreement.\r\nSaudi Aramco said it has taken steps to reduce the carbon intensity of its oil exploration and extraction activities, and it is investing in lower carbon solutions. \"The technologies required to meet carbon emission goals are yet to reach the levels of maturity required to provide the world\'s energy needs in an economically sustainable manner,\" it added.\r\nExxonMobil and Total did not respond to emailed requests for comment.\r\nIn 2019, ClientEarth submitted a complaint against BP (BP) in the United Kingdom on the basis of OECD guidelines, which stipulate fair advertising practices for multinational enterprises. BP later pulled an advertising campaign, called Possibilities Everywhere, and re-directed the funds to support its net zero ambitions. In 2020, the company pledged to stop \"corporate reputation advertising.\"\r\nFossil fuel advertising should be regulated along the same lines as tobacco, with \"health warnings\" about the dangers of climate change that identify fossil fuels as the main contributor to global warming, said ClientEarth.\r\nCompanies should also be clear about how much they are spending on fossil fuels compared to low carbon businesses, and they should be banned from directly promoting fossil fuel products, it added.\r\nTobacco advertising has been progressively restricted since the 1970s, with some countries banning it entirely. Warnings about the health risks associated with smoking, most notably lung cancer, have been mandatory on cigarette boxes in most countries for several decades. Brand-free packaging has also been introduced in some countries, a move Big Tobacco resisted fiercely.\r\nThe Paris agreement aims to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. To achieve that, fossil fuel production needs to be cut by roughly 6% every year, but current projections show an annual increase of 2%, according to the Production Gap Report.\r\nThe International Energy Agency said in a report last year that if today\'s power plants, industrial plants, buildings and vehicles continue to rely on burning fossil fuels that would lock in a temperature rise of 1.65 degrees Celsius.\r\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, without a sharp decline in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, global warming will surpass 1.5 degrees Celsius leading to \"irreversible loss\" of the most fragile ecosystems and ongoing climate crises for the world\'s most vulnerable people.\r\n— Ivana Kottasová contributed reporting.', '', '2021-04-19 14:23:39'),

Wen appeared to issue a coded criticism of Xi this week.', 'chinese.jpg', 'Hong Kong (CNN) Under President Xi Jinping, China\'s former leaders have grown accustomed to keeping their heads down.\r\n\r\nBut in an essay published this week, ostensibly a tribute to his late mother, former Premier Wen Jiabao appeared to issue what many have interpreted as a coded criticism of Xi: calling for fairness, justice, humanity and liberty, all while remembering a period of history the Communist Party would rather forget.\r\nWen\'s words took Chinese social media by the storm. His essay was shared hundreds of thousands of times -- before censors stepped in to stop people spreading it (yes, even the country\'s second-highest official for a decade could not escape China\'s increasingly stringent censorship).\r\nThe essay was published in an obscure newspaper in Macao, perhaps indicating no mainland Chinese outlet was willing to publish it. Wen could not be reached for comment about the piece.\r\nA poignant tribute to his mother, who died in December, Wen\'s essay touched on how his father, a teacher, was persecuted during the political and social upheaval of China\'s decade-long Cultural Revolution. During which time he was placed under house arrest and subject to brutal interrogation, scolding and beating. After one particularly bad beating, his father\'s face was so swollen it blocked his eyesight, Wen wrote.\r\nAnd at the end of the essay, Wen outlined a vision for an ideal China -- one that seemed to imply the country\'s current state is not meeting the 78-year-old\'s expectations.\r\n\"In my mind, China should be a country full of fairness and justice,\" Wen wrote. \"There should always be respect for the will of the people, humanity and the nature of human beings. There should always be youthfulness, freedom and a striving spirit.\"\r\nWhile to outsiders his criticism may be so subtle as to not merit censorship, for close followers of Chinese politics, an intervention by a party elder like Wen is remarkable, particularly as the government is cracking down on even the slightest deviations from the official narrative in the run-up to the Communist Party\'s centenary this July.\r\n\"Given the political climate, his speaking out itself is an important act -- and a veiled criticism against Xi,\" said Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing.\r\nChina\'s Premier from 2003 to 2013, Wen was widely considered to be a relatively liberal, reformist figure within the Chinese leadership. He was once a top aide to Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who was purged for opposing the violent crackdown against protesters on Beijing\'s Tiananmen Square in June, 1989.\r\nAnd he has been censored before: in an interview in 2010, Wen told CNN\'s Fareed Zakaria that freedom of speech was \"indispensable\" and the Chinese people\'s wishes for democracy and freedom were \"irresistible.\" After briefly going viral, the video was scrubbed from the Chinese internet.\r\nCompared to those comments, Wen\'s essay this week is far milder in tone, but the climate has changed dramatically, with both freedom of speech and any aspirations for democracy and freedom taking a major hit under Xi.\r\nThe business of China\r\nThe Boao Forum for Asia is back, and ready to give the world an idea of what doing business with China will look like post-pandemic.\r\nAfter missing 2020 as Covid-19 gripped the globe, Boao returns this year in China\'s Hainan province. Organizers say the event is the world\'s largest \"offline\" conference this year, according to Chinese state media. Some 4,000 people -- including representatives from various international organizations, companies and the media -- are attending in person, with many others participating online.\r\nThere\'s already been some buzz about China\'s ambitious plans for its digital yuan, which Beijing started rolling out a test version of last year. Li Bao, a deputy governor from the People\'s Bank of China, insisted Sunday night that the purpose of the digital version of the yuan was not to replace the US dollar or any other currency. The country wants to \"let the market decide,\" he said.\r\nAttention at Boao this week will also be on whether any high-profile American entrepreneurs and investors make headlines as the United States continues to navigate a tumultuous relationship with China.

In recent years, an army of nationalistic influencers and their followers have become powerful aides to the government-employed censors policing China\'s internet, swarming on those who speak out and intimidating them into silence.\r\nChina\'s feminist movement -- already subject to a harsh crackdown under Xi -- is the latest target of a sweeping online crusade against voices deemed \"unpatriotic.\" Trolls sift through years of posts on feminist social media accounts, searching for the slightest suggestion of alleged \"anti-China\" opinion.\r\nSometimes, as in Liang\'s case, even supporting victims of harassment is enough to prompt an onslaught of personal attacks.\r\nBut Liang refuses to be silenced. In a rare step, she filed a civil lawsuit this week against social media giant Weibo, demanding to have her account back.\r\n\"I want to show everyone that there are still efforts we can make to try and preserve the space we\'ve created together.

We recognize this investment will require concessions from all sides — both on the specifics of what\'s included as well as how it gets paid for.\"\r\nThe White House is laying the groundwork for lifting the corporate tax rate above its current level of 21% to help pay for an ambitious infrastructure package. Bezos\' statement is a notable show of approval for the move given that many others in the business community have warned that it could threaten recovery from the pandemic.\r\nThe outgoing Amazon chief executive is, in some ways, a surprising advocate for a corporate tax hike.\r\nIn 2019, the then-former Vice President Joe Biden called out Amazon for its history of using tax credits and deductions to reduce its corporate income tax bill. The company fired back, saying, \"we pay every penny we owe,\" and that it had paid $2.6 billion in corporate taxes since 2016.\r\nAnd again last year, then-Presidential candidate Biden said Amazon should \"start paying their taxes,\" as part of a broader critique of large, successful businesses. Amazon has repeatedly said that it follows all applicable tax laws.\r\nThe company also recently sparred with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has advocated for raising taxes on big corporations. Last month Warren said in a tweet: \"Giant corporations like Amazon report huge profits to their shareholders — but they exploit loopholes and tax havens to pay close to nothing in taxes. That\'s just not right.\"\r\nAmazon responded to her, saying: \"You make the tax laws @SenWarren; we just follow them. If you don\'t like the laws you\'ve created, by all means, change them. Here are the facts: Amazon has paid billions of dollars in corporate taxes over the past few years alone.\"\r\nFor the 2017 and 2018 tax years, Amazon\'s financial filings showed that it expected to receive money back from the federal government, not that it owed money in income tax. For the 2019 tax year, Amazon said it owed more than $1 billion in federal income tax.\r\nIn 2020, Amazon paid $1.7 billion in federal taxes, the company said in its response to Warren. Its net income for the year was $21.3 billion.\r\nWhile it has already drawn some criticism, the Biden administration\'s infrastructure plan may be compelling enough to convince more corporate leaders to sign on in support of hiking business taxes.\r\nBezos said in his statement: \"We look forward to Congress and the Administration coming together to find the right, balanced solution that maintains or enhances U.S. competitiveness.\"\r\nAnd he\'s not alone. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income for BlackRock, the world\'s largest asset manager, said rolling back Trump-era corporate tax cuts won\'t hurt the economy — and could actually be positive for growth.\r\nRieder told CNN Business last month that he thinks the US economy can \"definitely\" withstand higher corporate taxes, and suggested that raising the corporate rate could help ensure that economic gains are distributed more evenly among corporations and workers.\r\n\"The US economy is amazingly resilient,\" he said, \"and in fact will perform well when you get some of this income redistribution and consumption at an easier and a better place, particularly for lower and middle income.\"\r\n--CNN\'s Brian Fung and Matt Egan contributed to this report\r\n--Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the percentage of Amazon\'s 2019 income it owed in total US federal income taxes that year.', 'Clare Duffy', '2021-04-19 15:10:37'),

But this is a relatively new experience for the 78-year-old.', 'thailand.jpg', '\"As a kid, I lived on a boat part of the year and on land part of the year,\" Salamak tells me from his home on Ko Surin, an island-bound national park in Thailand\'s south.\r\n\"We would go to land during the monsoon season to look for tubers. After that, we would go back to our boats.\"\r\nSalamak is a member of Thailand\'s Moken ethnic group.\r\nAlso known as the \"sea gypsies\" or chao ley -- Thai for \"sea people\" -- the Moken lay claim to an astounding list of traits. They\'re one of the only groups of humans who, traditionally, lived predominately at sea, in houseboats called kabang.\r\nThey can hold their breath for remarkably long periods of time. And their ability to see underwater is reportedly better than anybody else\'s.\r\nThese skills were honed over centuries of nomadic living -- sailing, hunting and gathering among the islands of Myanmar\'s Mergui Archipelago and Thailand\'s upper Andaman Sea coast.\r\n\r\nTsunami forces Moken onto solid land\r\n\r\nThis unique lifestyle ended abruptly in 2005, after the previous year\'s tsunami. The Moken emerged from the disaster almost entirely unscathed, relying on traditional knowledge that taught them to seek higher ground to avoid the wave, but the Thai government ordered them to relocate to solid land, in a makeshift village within Ko Surin National Park.\r\nIn the years since, Thailand\'s Moken have, more or less, adapted to a relatively modern life. The 315 people who make up the village live in simple wood and bamboo houses outfitted with solar panels and running water. And for the first time, they have access to a relatively regular source of income in the form of tourism.\r\n\"The village makes income from selling stuff to tourists or leading boat tours,\" says Ngoey Klathalay (all Moken share the same surname), the village head, who tells me that on an average day as many as 100 people might visit his village.\r\nA 2019 fire that wiped out half of the village was yet another devastating blow to the community. But the pandemic, which has closed Thailand\'s doors to international tourism, stripping the Moken of what was virtually their only source of income, may prove to be an even greater challenge.\r\nBut if there\'s one group that has the skills to survive in tough times, it\'s undoubtedly the Moken.\r\n\"I don\'t have a home! I\'ve lived on this boat for two years now,\" says Hook Klathalay, Ngoey\'s brother, who estimates that he\'s the only Moken in Thailand who lives on a boat full time.\r\nAt 35, Hook is among the last of the generation of Moken who grew up at sea. When he was five, his parents moved to land so he could get an education.\r\nBut as an adult, Hook felt the pull to return to a traditional Moken life, a journey that\'s portrayed in the 2015 documentary, \"No Word for Worry.\"\r\nFor Hook, the first step in this process meant building a boat. Traditionally, Moken boats were hollowed out of massive logs, but national park rules prevent the Moken from cutting down trees.\r\nSo with financial assistance from the filmmakers, he designed a boat that blends Thai and Moken elements: built with planks and a longtail motor but also equipped with a Moken-style roof and a mast on which to raise the traditional pandanus leaf sail. The boat has seemingly served as an inspiration for other Moken, and in the years since, one more has been built.\r\n\"Other Moken told me that they want to live on a boat, in the ocean,\" Hook says, adding that the pressures of the pandemic have also caused the Moken to reassess their way of living.\r\n\"They want to be free, like me.\"\r\n\"We live day to day\"\r\nSpend some time on Hook\'s boat and it doesn\'t take long to see that his life revolves around the hunt. While we chat, he mends a net and lowers baited hooks into the water. One morning, I see him treading through shallow water with his son and a three-pronged spear, scanning for fish.\r\nAnother evening, in mid conversation, he leaps to the bow of his boat and casts a net into the water.\r\n\"As long as we have some rice, we can find the rest of what we need to live in the ocean,\" says Hook, who estimates that the majority of the food that he and his family eat he catches himself.\r\nHunting is strictly prohibited in Thailand\'s national parks, but officials have allowed the Moken to fish, hunt and gather if they use traditional methods, and only for their own consumption. This has proved to be a lifeline for the Moken during the pandemic.\r\n\"Covid has had a huge impact on the Moken,\" Hook says. \"Before, the Moken earned money by helping out on boats or doing odd jobs at the national park, but these jobs are gone now. And the Moken aren\'t Thai citizens, so they don\'t get any help from the government.\"\r\nTo witness Moken-style self-sufficiency firsthand, I ask Ngoey to take me along on a hunting trip. We jump in a boat and he heads to a small, rocky outcrop where a handful of Moken are chipping away at shells with a knife-like metal tool, collecting fingernail-sized oysters.\r\nAlthough bold, impressive feats such as spearfishing, exceptional underwater vision and the ability to hold one\'s breath have come to dominate popular depictions of the Moken, it doesn\'t take long to see that the bulk of the traditional Moken diet comes from the comparatively mundane gathering of items such as shellfish, crustaceans and small fish.\r\n\"We live day to day,\" Ngoey says. \"If we run out of food, we have to find more the next day; we don\'t have refrigerators!\"\r\nThe sea isn\'t the only source of food for the Moken. On another day, I accompany Ngoey and his wife to a wooded island where we dig in the sandy soil for edible tubers.\r\nIn the days before rice was commonplace, taro and yams were the main source of carbs for the Moken. We return to the village with a type of tuber that the Moken call marung. Boiled and peeled, they have a texture and flavor that reminds me of water chestnuts.\r\n\"I haven\'t eaten marung in 10 or more years!\" Ngoey tells me, clearly feeling a sense of nostalgia.\r\nBefore leaving Ko Surin, I ask Ngoey how he thinks the Moken have fared during this time.\r\n\"Since Covid, our income has been reduced, but in my opinion, not by a lot; we\'re not despairing, we\'re not starving.\r\n\"For a long time, we didn\'t depend on tourism, we\'ve only had it for a few years.

Fully vaccinated people are, of course, at much lower risk of contracting and spreading coronavirus than people who haven\'t been vaccinated. CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen advises approaching your activity decisions with that in mind.', 'indoor-dining.jpg', '(CNN) — As the vaccinated percentage of the population increases, you may be wondering whether now is finally the time to enjoy a meal that isn\'t homemade or takeout.\r\nIndoor dining and drinking at restaurants and bars is riskier than some other places for a few reasons, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Not only are people from different households gathering in the same space, but you have to take your mask off to eat and drink.\r\n\"You still have to be very careful with being in these areas,\" said Dr. Ada Stewart, a family physician with Cooperative Health in Columbia, South Carolina, and the president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. \"You\'re in a crowd, and you don\'t know the status of many of these individuals.\"\r\nBecause of the layout of restaurants, maintaining social distancing may be hard. And since restaurants can be noisy, people might talk louder and more forcefully, which could increase the chance of spreading coronavirus through respiratory droplets. Depending on a restaurant\'s ventilation flow, respiratory droplets and air potentially laden with coronavirus can accumulate or spread beyond 6 feet.\r\nGiven these risks, the CDC\'s guidance on indoor restaurant dining is the same for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people.\r\nIf you\'re fully vaccinated and you become infected, you\'re not likely to become sick with Covid-19 symptoms, Stewart said. But you \"may potentially expose someone else to illness, who may end up getting a serious disease.\"\r\nIf you\'re planning to eat out, first check whether the restaurant is complying with the CDC\'s recommended prevention measures. You can look at the restaurant\'s website or call the business and ask. Restaurants that reduce risks include establishments that have outdoor, distanced seating available; have both staff and guests wear masks when not eating or drinking; and have their menu available online.\r\nEating and drinking at an establishment\'s outdoor space is safer, the CDC says, since air or respiratory droplets potentially laden with coronavirus wouldn\'t be flowing around in an enclosed space.\r\nLimit your alcohol consumption so that you can use adequate judgment. Ask for individually wrapped condiments -- including salt, pepper and ketchup -- if possible, and don\'t share food.

Personally, that would include seeing \"The Wind and the Lion\" as a kid back in the mid-1970s, watching Sean Connery -- who will be among the standout names in this year\'s Academy Awards \"In Memoriam\" segment -- wield a sword in epic, swashbuckling fashion.\r\nThe Oscars have always served as what amounts to a primetime commercial for the movies, celebrating their past as well as their present and promoting them to a global audience. But while a year of pandemic-related shutdowns hasn\'t dampened enthusiasm for escaping into entertainment, it has placed dark clouds over the future of theaters, and whether people fed a steady diet of streaming content into their homes will be lured out of them as readily, especially if public-health concerns about mass gatherings and crowded indoor spaces linger.\r\nThe conversation on social media immediately turned to efforts to \"save\" the Cinerama Dome in particular, and it seems possible that someone will, whether that\'s a consortium or an entity like Netflix -- which bought Hollywood\'s Egyptian Theatre last year -- recognizing the goodwill that would come from ensuring the survival of such a historic landmark.\r\nThe broader question of what happens to movies and movie going, however, remains a mystery.

Yet despite that high-profile roster of heroes, it\'s a battle the studios deploying them appear somewhat conflicted about winning.', 'scarlett.jpg', 'Disney has announced that \"Black Widow,\" the eagerly anticipated Marvel prequel starring Scarlett Johansson, will receive a simultaneous streaming release via Disney+ -- for a $30 premium -- in addition to hitting movie theaters in July. The model builds on what Warner Bros. tried with \"Wonder Woman 1984\" on HBO Max, minus the extra fee, and the exclusive $30 experiment with Disney\'s live-action \"Mulan\" in September.\r\nThe announcement -- and indeed, the last year of \"Will they or won\'t they?\" speculation about shifting major titles to streaming during the pandemic -- has unleashed a new round of discussion about what the right price should be for the privilege of watching such movies at home.\r\nThe related issue is that even studios remain unsure over how much they want to drive such viewing, given the sizable tradeoffs associated with promoting their streaming ventures at the expense of undermining movie-theater distribution, and the billion-dollar revenues that just one comic-book-style hit can generate.\r\nWhat exactly does that tradeoff entail? The truth -- and the problem -- is that nobody precisely knows where the sweet spot is.\r\nHow many people crave the theatrical experience enough to bypass watching at home? How many movies can go to streaming without killing off theaters? What percentage of consumers who might not rush out to see \"Black Widow\" would pay to watch if all they have to do is push a few buttons to enjoy it with microwave popcorn on the couch?\r\nStudios eager to build subscriber bases recognize sci-fi epics or showcases for Marvel and DC superheroes with $200-million budgets can\'t be fully supported by fees for Disney+ and HBO Max, respectively, meaning they need to preserve a theatrical model. (HBO Max is part of WarnerMedia, as is CNN.)\r\nThose who gripe that $30 is a lot to ask for at-home viewing thus miss the point -- namely, that studios are engaged in a delicate balancing act, wanting to make their streaming services more attractive while still erecting enough of a barrier cost-wise to prevent a wholesale exodus away from traditional movie-going.\r\nThe pandemic has fueled such experimentation, in part out of necessity. Warner Bros. moved its entire 2021 slate to play simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max -- with \"Godzilla vs. Kong\" arriving March 31 on those terms -- but recently set a deal with Regal Cinemas that would restore a window of theatrical exclusivity next year, Deadline reported.\r\nStill, doubt understandably lingers as to whether US theater attendance will come roaring back by the late spring or summer -- even with vaccine distribution exceeding the Biden administration\'s early estimates -- reflecting uncertainty over what the consumer market will look like in a few months\' time, and the level of pent-up demand for out-of-home experiences.\r\n\"Black Widow\" could provide one of the truer tests of that, coming out during the summer, when more people will likely view going to theaters as a more reasonable option.\r\nA few distributors, notably, are wagering that such demand will return sooner. Lionsgate, for example, is touting its planned May 14 release of \"Spiral: From the Book of Saw,\" starring Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson, saying the film \"will kick off a robust summer moviegoing season.\"\r\nThe one indisputable fact is that Hollywood built up streaming during the pandemic while movie theaters sat dormant, sacrificing hundreds of millions of dollars in ticket sales. For the past year, amid delayed releases and fluctuating public-health news, streaming movies wasn\'t so much a master plan as trying to make the best of a terrible situation.\r\nThe big bet now in this high-stakes poker game appears to be on the fall, hoping that movie-goers will be ready by then to resume old habits. New York is targeting the same window for Broadway theaters, which could add to the sense of anticipation.\r\nAt this point, though, the entertainment industry has probably never known less about audience preferences not in terms of content, necessarily, but the when, where and how much.

(In a break from tradition, no family members will be in military uniform, averting a potential dilemma, as Prince Harry was stripped of his titles when he stepped down from royal duties).\r\nEven in times of grief, close attention is paid to how royal family members interpret dress codes, which date back hundreds of years and have shifted over time.\r\nIn 1982, widely seen photos of Princess Diana at the funeral of actress and Princess of Monaco Grace Kelly\'s show the newly wedded royal in a veiled straw hat, collared long-sleeve black dress and heart necklace -- an appropriate choice that still showed her inherent sense of style.\r\n\"(Princess Diana had) that sense of having an eye to what the public expects, and just knowing how to strike the right note,\" said British fashion historian and curator Kate Strasdin in a video interview.\r\nTaken during the Princess of Wales\' own funeral in 1997, the heartbreaking image of Prince Philip, Prince William, Diana\'s brother Charles Spencer, Prince Harry and Prince Charles walking behind the coffin in dark suits is one of the most referenced photos in contemporary royal history and emblematic of modern royal funeral attire. Nicole Kidman and Elton John were among the celebrities who duly abided by the all-black and formal dress code to pay their respects during a funeral watched by millions around the world.\r\n\'A visual symbol of grief\'\r\nThough black has long been the color of choice for mourning -- it was popular among the wealthy during the Middle Ages -- it became ubiquitous with grief in the 19th century.\r\nAccording to Strasdin, it was during this period in Europe and America that mourning dress codes took hold, particularly for women, bolstered by the rise of women\'s publications as well as more affordable clothes. (Harper\'s Bazaar, for example, advised readers to aim for a \"nun-like simplicity\" in 1868.)\r\nEven the modern department store was born from the nascent funeral industry. Around the 1840s, Strasdin said, the \"massive emporiums\" that cropped up in London and Paris were meant to serve as a single stop for funerary needs.\r\n\"Under one roof, you could acquire everything from stationery to the mourning jewelry,\" she said.\r\nA person\'s mourning style \"served as a visual symbol of grief... while simultaneously demonstrating the wearer\'s status, taste and level of propriety,\" noted the introductory text to the 2014 exhibition \"Death Becomes Her: A Century of Mourning Attire\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\r\nThe etiquette author D.C. Colesworthy had a cheekier take on the trend in his 1867 book \"Hints of Common Politeness,\" as quoted in the Met exhibition. \"When we see ladies persist in wearing sable, we are reminded of the reply a young widow made to her mother: \'Don\'t you see,\' said she, \'it saves me the expense of advertising for a husband,\" he wrote.\r\nBlack was briefly retired in 1938, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II\'s grandmother, the Countess of Strathmore. A photograph shows the Queen Mother wearing a white dress designed by Norman Hartnell to honor her mother\'s passing. The concept of \"white mourning\" followed the example of Mary, Queen of Scots, who was painted in a white mourning dress after she lost multiple family members in the 16th century.\r\nThe \'perpetual widow\'\r\nBut no one had more influence on mourning attire than Queen Victoria. Following her husband Prince Albert\'s unexpected death in 1861, the monarch very publicly expressed her sorrow by wearing black every day for four decades until her own death. It was Victoria who helped codify the nuances of grief fashion and maintained her identity as the \"perpetual widow,\" according to Strasdin.\r\nIn the Victorian era, \"even really small details of dress indicating what stage of mourning you\'re in became really important,\" Strasdin explained. It showed wealth and status to be able to afford an entire mourning wardrobe, as well as society know-how to understand all of the rules.\r\nFor a year and a day, widows were expected to wear full mourning attire, known as \"widow\'s weeds,\" which consisted of matte black crepe fabric with no embellishments, according to Strasdin. As one\'s grief faded, colors and other fabrics could be slowly reintroduced. Finally, for the last six months of the two-and-a-half-year period, \"half mourning\" garments could be worn in white, gray, pale yellow or shades of lilac or lavender. Sometimes they were a vibrant purple -- the exhibition \"Death Becomes Her\" displayed one such gown of wool twill and silk velvet, with bold shoulders, black trim and intricate white and gold detailing.\r\nThough it was customary to return to a normal wardrobe following the years-long grieving period, Queen Victoria persisted in wearing black mourning outfits for the rest of her life. As \"Death Becomes Her\" showed, one of Victoria\'s dresses from 1894 -- 33 years after Albert\'s death -- was a somber black crepe gown with a simple trim.\r\nVictoria\'s eternal show of grief was unpopular with her subjects as it encouraged a more rigid dress code, Strasdin notes. Her daughter-in-law, Queen Alexandra, marked a shift, loosening restrictions when Queen Victoria passed and after her own eldest son died. Alexandra opted for glittering half-mourning gowns of mauve silk chiffon and sequins, as well as pale yellows and grays.\r\n\"She knew that the public had really struggled with Victoria\'s continual mourning,\" Strasdin said. \"So Queen Alexandra adopted half-mourning for the rest of her life, because she knew that to go into full mourning would really not have been a popular public choice.\"\r\nOver the decades, the impractically-long mourning wardrobe traditions went out of style, but Victoria\'s influence is still present in modern royal mourning periods, from the austere colors to the rigid adherence to dress codes. \"In spite of the changes, I think the 19th century still looms large,\" Strasdin said.', 'Jacqui Palumbo', '2021-04-19 15:51:52');

This month, the Gropius Bau in Berlin is due to open a twice-postponed Kusama retrospective -- her first in Germany -- which will recreate eight seminal exhibitions that took place between 1952 and 1983, and illustrate how the artist\'s practice and mediums have evolved throughout her career.\r\nMeanwhile, a much-anticipated exhibition of two of Kusama\'s \"Infinity Mirror Rooms\" at London\'s Tate Modern has been rescheduled from last year and is now due to open in May, but coronavirus restrictions will seriously hamper the numbers that can visit the immersive installations.

(27, 5, 5, 'Launched during the Cold War, Chinatown\'s pageants were about much more than beauty', 'In February of last year, the Miss Chinatown USA pageant in San Francisco crowned its newest winner: the then-18-year-old Lauren Yang of Sugar Land, Texas.', 'chinatown.jpg', 'Across four competition categories -- titled beauty and poise, talent presentation, verbal communication and swimsuit/fitness and form -- Yang, a Harvard University student, gave a speech on the importance of gender equality and performed a classical piano piece. Alongside 11 other contestants, she also answered an interview question and walked the stage in a swimsuit, then a cheongsam, in front of an audience of hundreds and a judging panel comprised of local community leaders and representatives from the business, arts and entertainment sectors.\r\nThe yearly event is both quintessentially American, like the Miss America pageants that inspired it, and remarkably Chinese. Emcees host in English, Mandarin and Cantonese, and contestants often showcase Chinese arts, like ribbon dancing or playing traditional stringed instruments.\r\nYang first fell into pageantry through cultural activities. Growing up near Houston, which has a large Asian community, she spent her weekends attending Chinese school and folk dance classes, hearing of the contests from classmates who had competed. Yang\'s parents, electrical engineers from China who first moved to the US for grad school, signed her and her sister up for the Miss Chinatown Houston pageant with the aim of making them less shy. Both won, in separate years, and both went on to claim the nationwide Miss Chinatown USA title, too.\r\nReflecting on her victory after the emergence of the recent Stop Asian Hate campaign, Yang told CNN that the Covid-19 pandemic\'s impact on Asian American communities made 2020 an especially meaningful year to have competed, describing the experience as a \"space to celebrate Chinese culture, history and tradition.\"\r\n\"At the height of Lunar New Year celebrations in February, we paraded on the streets -- corners filled with local Asian vendors and brightened by lion dances and cultural performances. Within a month, the streets emptied. Where our culture was celebrated, our people were now loathed and blamed.\r\n\"These very streets are now where our elders are being attacked,\" she added, where anti-Asian rhetoric \"hangs with suffocating weight in the air.\"\r\nYang, now aged 19, could just as easily be talking about the first Miss Chinatown pageant in the 1950s, a period of similar anti-Asian xenophobia. And although those early competitions ultimately helped challenge racial prejudices, they also reinforced other stereotypes -- of women, in particular -- that later generations would find limiting.\r\nAs the American zeitgeist has shifted, from the Cold War through the civil rights movement and multiple waves of feminism, Miss Chinatown USA has continued to shape, and be shaped by, the ever-changing ideals of Chinese American womanhood.\r\nYellow peril, red scare\r\nThe 1950s were a fearful time for Asians in America. China had \"fallen\" to communism in 1949, and when the newly formed People\'s Republic of China (PRC) entered the Korean War the following year -- pitting it directly against the US -- Chinese Americans feared being interned, just as Japanese Americans had been during World War II.\r\nSome leftists and PRC symphathizers were indeed deported or jailed, and Chinatowns were surveilled, though measures stopped short of mass internment. America meanwhile imposed an embargo against mainland China that, in an instant, paralyzed the many Chinatown businesses that relied on imported goods, from pharmacies and groceries to gift shops.\r\nIt was in this environment that community and business leaders in San Francisco\'s Chinatown hatched a plan to improve its public image and encourage tourism: a day of cultural activities, capped by a parade to mark Chinese New Year. Though the community had previously staged its own new year celebrations, this one would be explicitly public -- a place to \"invite our American friends ... to appreciate and learn things about (the) Chinese,\" as organizer Henry Kwock \"H.K.\" Wong put it.\r\nThe image that organizers wished to project was that of a patriotic, assimilated community, compatible with American values. The first of the parades, in 1953, was led by a Chinese American veteran who had been blinded in the Korean War. He was followed by an Anti-Communist League car and Chinese school marching bands.\r\nIn 1954, Wong added a local Miss Chinatown pageant (which had been held since 1948) to the festival lineup. The competition proved so popular that, in 1958, it was expanded into Miss Chinatown USA, a national-level pageant featuring 17 young women from around the country, many of whom had been Miss Chinatown winners in other cities.\r\nThe event was a hit, attracting interest from both within the Chinese community and across greater San Francisco. The first winner, June Gong of Miami, Florida, was a college senior studying home economics who had won a Miss Chinatown competition in New York City the previous year. She was crowned by the mayor of San Francisco, and her smiling image -- complete with a cheongsam, heels, lipstick and curled, 1950s-style hair -- appeared in newspapers across the country.\r\nThe cheongsams worn by contestants were key to the early pageants\' success, argues scholar Chiou-ling Yeh in her book \"Making an American Festival: Chinese New Year in San Francisco\'s Chinatown.\"\r\n\"By this time, Chinese Americans had long been Orientalized by their fellow Americans -- in other words, they were portrayed as exotic and distinctly different from White Americans,\" Yeh wrote. \"(Community) leaders understood that only by appealing to the American Orientalist imagination could they distinguish themselves from the Red Chinese and, in addition, draw more tourists into Chinatown.\"\r\nContestants parading in cheongsams marked a notable departure from the community\'s earlier pageants, in which participants generally assumed Western dress. The tight-fitting garments were considered sexy and exotic and, Yeh argues, had the benefit of being associated, in American minds, with figures like Madame Chiang Kai-shek, the Western-educated First Lady of China\'s pre-communist republic, who had toured the US to great fanfare in 1943, appearing on magazine covers and dazzling Congress in (a decidedly more conservative version of) a cheongsam.\r\nAt Miss Chinatown USA, Wong hoped the garment would present spectators with the perfect blend of East and West. He wrote that the winner should conjure \"the centuries-old Chinese concept of beauty\" described in classical literature, \"such as melon-seed face, new moon eyebrows, phoenix eyes, peachlike cheek, shapely nose, cherry lips, medium height, willowy figure, radiant smile and jet black hair.\" However, he also wanted the winner to embody American notions of progress, with \"adequate education, training and the versatility to meet the challenge of the modern world.\"\r\nWhether the inaugural winner fit this profile was debatable: One woman who worked on the pageant said in a 2002 interview that Gong \"was not glamorous\" and \"not beautiful.\" However, she believed Gong won because, when asked who her hero was, she answered not Marie Curie or Eleanor Roosevelt, like other contestants, but \"my mother\" -- a response that garnered \"a couple minutes of applause.\"\r\nFeminism and rising power\r\nIn the ensuing years, Miss Chinatown USA boomed in popularity. It moved to larger venues that seated thousands of spectators, was embraced by San Francisco\'s tourism board and was covered by global media. But as 1950s conservatism made way for the social upheavals of the late \'60s and \'70s, a new generation of youth activists, influenced by the civil rights, feminist, Black liberation and anti-war movements, began voicing concerns about the contest.\r\nThe lifting of immigration restrictions in 1965 drastically expanded the working-class population of San Francisco\'s Chinatown. Community advocates complained that they had more pressing concerns than pageantry. Criticisms of the contest, as detailed by Asian American studies professor Judy Tzu-Chun Wu in a 1997 paper, included: that it promoted a stereotype of Asian women as submissive or exotic \"China Dolls\"; that the winners were usually affluent and educated, when Chinatown itself was mostly working class; that contestants were being judged by White beauty standards (since its inception, the pageant\'s judging panel has included a mix of Asians and non Asians); that it served tourism and businesses rather than local residents; and that it reinforced the image of a \"model minority\" at a time when the city\'s Chinese community -- often poor and ignored by City Hall -- badly needed resources.\r\nThese objections spoke to wider, conflicting visions of what San Francisco\'s Chinatown should be. According to Wu\'s research, things came to a head in 1971, when the Holiday Inn chain opened a hotel in the neighborhood, and, as a publicity stunt, had a Miss Chinatown contestant jump out of a fortune cookie. Across the street, a radical Asian youth group and other activists protested the opening, calling it an \"invasion of Chinatown\'s territory,\" while demanding more low-cost housing for residents. Several weeks later, during that year\'s Lunar New Year parade, protesters threw eggs at the 16-year-old contestant concerned, and she was removed from the float.\r\nAt the time, pageant organizers largely dismissed the criticisms. But, much like Miss America, the contest has evolved in line with the feminist movement and changing visions of womanhood. The \"swimsuit competition\" is now called \"swimsuit/fitness and form\" though, unlike Miss America, the category has not been eliminated. And where contestants once talked about wanting to be a good wife and mother, on-stage interviews now emphasize community service, individual achievement and career ambitions. The most recent winners have embodied present-day ideals of academic success and upward mobility, including several Harvard students and women who have gone on to careers in fields including management consultancy and technology.\r\n\"The ideal Miss Chinatown USA embodies the best of both cultures -- the East and the West,\" said a representative of the San Francisco Chinese Chamber of Commerce via email. \"She serves as a positive role model for young women and as an ambassadress for the Chinese communities throughout the United States. She possesses inner and outer beauty. She is intelligent, talented, articulate, poised and community service oriented.\"\r\nYet, despite its seemingly more progressive values, Miss Chinatown USA has, like pageants elsewhere, waned in popularity and relevance. While winners would once spend a year visiting Chinese communities across America, and even traveling to Hong Kong and Taiwan, their responsibilities are now relatively local and stretch little beyond the two-week festival period.\r\nNonetheless, the pageant still attracts criticism. Since 2002, performance artist Kristina Wong has crashed several Miss Chinatown USA events as the satirical character \"Fannie Wong, former Miss Chinatown 2nd runner-up.\" Chomping on a cigar, humping attendees\' legs and generally defying stereotypes of Asian women as quiet and demure, she was removed by security on more than one occasion.\r\n\"The only things Fannie threatens are the unrealistic ideals of \'perfection,\' beauty, and gender normative behavior placed on Chinese American women,\" Wong wrote in 2012, in an apology letter sent to a community organization she had snuck into the parade with, but said she had no affiliation to.\r\nProviding a space\r\nLooking back, reigning Miss Chinatown USA Lauren Yang has mixed feelings about her experience. On the one hand, she found some aspects of the pageant patriarchal and \"very rooted in tradition.\" The entry criteria, for example, only defines Chinese ancestry as having a father, not a mother, of Chinese descent. She also had qualms about the swimsuit competition, which wasn\'t a component of previous pageants she had competed in.\r\nOn the other hand, Yang enjoyed the community aspects of the pageant that she and other former contestants have cited as a primary reason for participating. Yang, who had not previously been to San Francisco, spent the week after the pageant visiting important community organizations in the nation\'s oldest Chinatown, learning about its history and \"getting to meet different Chinese American leaders who were working on (causes) I didn\'t even know existed,\" such as gaining recognition for Chinese American veterans from World War II.\r\nThis sense of connection to Chinese American history has stayed with her, Yang said. After returning to Harvard, she began volunteering for a campus program that teaches US history and civics to immigrants preparing for the citizenship test. She also taught a summer course on Chinese American history and culture that \"included a lot of things I learned through my Miss Chinatown USA participation,\" from the Chinese Exclusion Act to Chinese American representation in today\'s media.\r\n\"Growing up, I didn\'t think I should be someone who takes up space, in the sense that I shouldn\'t speak up, or I should minimize or qualify what I have to say,\" Yang said. \"That\'s something that I still struggle with.\r\n\"But this pageant was one of the first times where I was intentionally and purposefully taking up space -- on stage, in the community -- and being fully sure of who I was.\"\r\nTop image caption: 1958 Miss Chinatown winner June Gong meets people on the streets.', 'Eveline Chao', '2021-04-19 16:02:52'),
(28, 6, 7, 'How the Trump era made redistricting more complicated', 'The political upheaval caused by the rise of former President Donald Trump has forced party operatives and elected officials tasked with laying out the nation\'s congressional districts for the next decade to determine whether those shifts were aberrations or signs of more lasting changes.', 'donald.jpg', 'Trump\'s tenure saw dramatic shifts for both parties. Appalled by the then-President\'s caustic politics, voters in suburbs across America fled the Republican Party, backing Democrats in the 2018 midterms and Joe Biden two years later. Democrats also saw gains with more highly educated Americans. And Trump\'s time in office saw rural voters consolidating behind Republicans, as well as the GOP making significant inroads with Latinos in South Florida and South Texas.\r\nRepublicans and Democrats charged with overseeing the redistricting process in states across the country now have to evaluate these changes as they embark on making once-in-a-decade adjustments to the districts that go a long way to determining the makeup -- and control -- of the House of Representatives.\r\n\"It\'s the million-dollar question,\" Michael Li, a senior counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice whose work focuses on redistricting and voting rights, said of whether the changes during Trump\'s tenure will be permanent. \"Map makers tend to be nothing if not cautious and the cautious thing to do is to assume that the changes that work against you or your party are permanent, while the changes that work in your favor are temporary.\"\r\nCongressional districts are redrawn every 10 years, using the latest Census data -- along with data points ranging from education levels, wealth and historic voting patterns -- to draw congressional seats. Republicans, because of their control of a majority of state legislatures, have been far more successful in drawing maps that favor their party.\r\nDemocrats have responded with a two-pronged approach with vastly different levels of success. First, operatives and lawyers have filed a number of successful lawsuits alleging that the other party is illegally engaging in gerrymandering, particularly along racial lines. Secondly, Democrats have looked to turn the redistricting process into a political issue, committing more millions to try to win back state legislatures ahead of the redistricting process. Those efforts have been far less successful.\r\nIn the majority of states, maps are redrawn and accepted by state legislatures, with many giving authority to the state\'s governor to either approve or deny the new districts. Only a handful of states, including Arizona, Colorado and Michigan, rely on relatively independent commissions to determine new maps.\r\nFor those tasked with redistricting, especially in states with some political control, the pressure to get these calculations right is immense, given that the process could determine control of the House of Representatives for years to come. Adding pressure to these calculations are dramatic demographic shifts across the country, with states in the upper Midwest and northeast likely to lose seats in Congress, while states like Georgia, Texas, Florida and North Carolina are set to add seats because of growth largely fueled by minority voters.\r\n\"It is the question when it comes to redistricting this cycle,\" Adam Kincaid, the head of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, said of how lasting the changes seen during the Trump administration may be. And it has forced people to ask themselves whether this is \"the beginning of a new long term normal or at these temporary fluxes that we are feeling right now.\"\r\n\"I don\'t think anyone has the answer to that,\" he said.\r\nThe states that lose, and those that win\r\nExperts believe that a slate of upper Midwest and northeastern states, like Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Ohio, are likely to lose some seats once delayed census data is released later this year. That puts pressure on politicians in each state to ensure the seat that is lost does not come from their side of the aisle. While some of these states are guided by independent commissions, a state like Ohio is under Republican control, meaning conservatives in the state can work to ensure the district being lost hurts Democrats.\r\nStates in the so-called Sun Belt, including Arizona, Texas, Florida and North Carolina, are expected to gain the seats being lost by their counterparts to the North. While an independent commission determines Arizona\'s districts, the process in Texas, Florida and North Carolina are all guided by their respective state legislature -- which are all controlled by Republicans.\r\nThe impact of these changes will be felt across the country, in both major metropolitan areas and rural communities.\r\nIn New Mexico, where Democrats control both the state legislature and governor\'s mansion, the party is expected to redraw the state\'s 2nd Congressional District, a district that is currently Republican leaning and represented by Republican Yvette Herrell.\r\nIn Texas, Republicans are in total control of the process but confronting the reality that the explosive growth in the state is coming from the more competitive and diversifying suburbs around cities like Austin, Dallas and Houston, and not in the reliably Republican West Texas, whose population growth has not kept apace.\r\nAnd in places like Ohio, a state that demographers expect will lose a congressional seat, Republicans are expected to use their near total control of the redistricting process to ensure that the congressional district does not come from their column.\r\nAccording to Kelly Ward Burton, the president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, the issue facing Republicans in growing states is that much of that growth, especially in the suburbs, have come from minority populations. If Republicans embark on cutting up these populations and combining them with more reliably Republican voters in exurbs and rural areas, the party will be opening themselves up to racial gerrymandering claims.\r\n\"The presumption that Republicans should get all of those new seats simply because they control the process is a presumption of gerrymandering,\" Ward Burton said. \"And that is illegal.\"\r\nFor Republicans, said Li with the Brennan Center, the problem area is the South. The party has the most control of the process in states like Georgia, Texas and Florida, he said, but it is more difficult to gerrymander in those states without exposing the state to race based claims.\r\n\"(In the South) the problem with white Democrats is they tend to live near white Republicans, sometimes in the same house, so unless you\'re gerrymandering down somebody\'s bed ... it\'s really hard to gerrymander white Democrats when there aren\'t that many of them,\" said Li. \"It\'s much more efficient because of residential segregation to target communities of color. And so you really can\'t politically gerrymander in the South without targeting communities of color, which gets you right into race-based claims.\"\r\nBattleground burbs\r\nThe nation\'s suburbs figure to be the key battleground in these states, considering the bulk of changes in these areas have come from the diversifying suburbs around some of the nation\'s biggest cities. In these Republican-controlled states, past redistricting fights have divided up metropolitan areas and joined them with more Republican exurban and rural areas, thereby diluting the Democratic advantage in these areas.\r\nEach party would be working to spread out their supporters in different districts with or without the Trump era political changes. But those shifts have added yet another level of uncertainty to the process.\r\n\"For people who did this stuff a decade ago, if they had known that Donald Trump was going to come along in 2016 and shift the American electorate, there\'s at least a couple dozen seats around the country that would have been drawn differently than they were,\" said Kincaid. \"And that is the challenge for the next few years is trying to forecast out how much this realignment is permanent versus temporary.\"\r\nDemocrats over the last decade have grown more focused on redistricting and gerrymandering and this year they are most focused on states where Republicans are not only in control but are gaining the power that come with redrawing another seat.\r\nMore aggressive actions by Democrats, along with changes in states to make the redistricting process less partisan, have made it harder for Republicans to protect their past redistricting work in some states. That\'s why people like Ward Burton and other Democrats focused on redistricting believe the party will try to do whatever they can in places like Florida, Georgia and Texas to gain seats.\r\nThe latest redistricting process is also playing out at a time where Democrats are drawing considerably more attention to gerrymandering, making it an important political issue, especially to minority communities who are often the most hurt by partisan redistricting.\r\nJasmine Burney-Clark, who runs the Equal Ground Education Fund in Florida, recently began preparing activists to lobby on the redistricting process, teaching a range of community and faith leaders about what role they could play in advocating for fair redistricting in a state where the process is controlled by Republicans. The effort comes years after a drawn-out process in 2010 led to numerous lawsuits and a drawn-out process.\r\n\"We\'re definitely preparing for what could possibly come, because we\'ve seen this before,\" Burney-Clark said. \"Our hope is that they\'ve learned a lesson and attempt to do that this time around with black and Brown folks, but we know that they will try to squeeze anything they can out to it as advantageous as possible.\"\r\nThis story has been updated to include Kelly Ward Burton\'s full married name.', 'Dan Merica', '2021-04-19 16:27:32'),

It helped the country break free from a monarchy and withstand the pull of fascism, dictatorships and communism.', 'gun-covid.jpg', 'But in today\'s interconnected global world of easily manufactured weapons and easily transmitted disease, protecting freedoms is coming at an ever greater cost.\r\nWe\'re used to thinking of the fight for freedom in terms of wars fought abroad, like the long fight in Afghanistan.\r\nBut America\'s longest war isn\'t in Afghanistan, it\'s right here at home.\r\nFar more deadly and uniquely American than any military conflict, the US gun war is raging in US cities and suburbs, in schools, and offices, at churches and grocery stores.\r\nAmericans who didn\'t volunteer for duty are on the front lines and dying for your freedoms every single day.\r\nThe latest battlefield erupted in Indianapolis Thursday night, where eight people were gunned down in a few minutes at a FedEx facility.\r\nThe \"liberty\" promised by the Declaration of Independence is interfering with the \"life\" and the \"pursuit of happiness\" in ways the Founding Fathers could never have imagined.\r\nGiven the choice, with help from conservative courts and Second Amendment true believers, the country is choosing personal freedom over public safety, giving some of its people a feeling of liberty, but also causing many people to die in the process.\r\n\'National embarrassment,\' but not necessarily the next priority\r\nBiden called the endless roll of mass shootings \"a national embarrassment\" at a Friday afternoon news conference, but he pushed back on a question about his administration prioritizing infrastructure over pushing for new gun control, calling on Congress to act. \"It doesn\'t mean that I can\'t also be working at the same time on the economy and on Covid, but it\'s not a question of my being able to set the agenda in the Senate as to what they will move to first.\"\r\nIn today\'s US, where everything seems like a partisan, political fight, the subject might be Covid restrictions or gun control, but it\'s generally the same Republican lawmakers and governors pushing liberty versus a science and public health crowd pushing statistics about lives lost.\r\nThere have been 45 mass shootings in the US in the past month. But most gun deaths won\'t be in mass shootings. More have died this year by suicide, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive. More than twice as many Americans have already died from gun violence in 2021 than servicemembers died in Afghanistan in nearly twenty years.\r\nWhen Biden promised this week to get American troops out of Afghanistan after 20 years by September 11, he marked the sacrifice of 2,300 servicemembers who volunteered to serve and lost their lives there, protecting the country.\r\nHe\'s mostly powerless in the gun war, however, since courts have interpreted the Second Amendment to give Americans easy access to guns and much of the country votes like it is afraid the government will take its guns away.\r\nWhile there is some small movement in Congress toward new background check measures, there remains a sacrosanct belief in an inalienable right to weaponry in portions of the country, abetted by the Supreme Court\'s interpretation that the Second Amendment has more to do with individuals and handguns than a well-regulated militia.\r\nProtecting the Second Amendment at all costs is written in stone on the Republican political platform and even most Democrats are unwilling to address the root cause of gun violence, which is not that the wrong people have guns, but that there are so very many guns that are so very easy to obtain. The majority of gun deaths, after all, are suicides.\r\nFor some, the government is already overreaching\r\nWhile the segments of American society trying to protect the Second Amendment may worry about the government taking their guns, Black Americans need to be seriously worried about the government taking their lives.\r\nThe country is no longer able to ignore how unarmed Black men -- George Floyd to Daunte Wright and beyond -- are routinely killed by police.\r\nSocial media and bodycam video along with trials like the one of former Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin make it impossible for those men to be buried in statistics. The repeated police killing of Black men is as unacceptable as the inevitability that another mass shooting will occur.\r\n\"We need to be clear when we\'re talking about, this is not a Black versus White issue. This is a right versus wrong issue,\" said Angela Rose Myers, president of the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP, during an appearance on CNN Friday. \"And people in our state and our government should not be murdering their citizens.\"\r\nRelated: Pressure grows on Senate to pass police reform bill\r\nHere again, there is slow movement in Congress to pass new federal policing standards, but every day it seems like Americans wake up to a new example of police killing someone.\r\nThe spirit of those Second Amendment arguments is evident in a new interest in the First Amendment, which protects the rights of assembly and worship -- rights that some Americans feel are being overrun by state orders and recommendations to practice social distancing during the pandemic.\r\nRep. Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, went after Dr. Anthony Fauci in a heated exchange on Capitol Hill Thursday, demanding to know when Americans can have their freedoms back from the pandemic.\r\n\"What metrics, what measures, what has to happen before Americans get more freedoms back?\"\r\nThe director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases laid out reality.\r\n\"Right now, we have about 60,000 infections a day, which is a very large risk for resurge. We\'re not talking about liberties. We\'re talking about a pandemic that has killed 560,000 Americans,\" said Fauci, who later said his \"best estimate\" would be to have the number of infections per day \"well below\" 10,000.\r\nA pandemic and an epidemic\r\nIt\'s hard to separate these two crises. Dr. Leana Wen, the former health commissioner for Baltimore and a CNN medical analyst, was asked by CNN\'s Kate Bolduan about gun violence just after speaking about Covid on Friday.\r\n\"I\'m an ER doctor,\" she said. \"We undoubtedly understand that gun violence is a health emergency. It\'s also a public health emergency.\"\r\nShe said the government needs to use tools to address the crisis and compared the regulation of guns to the regulation of cars.\r\n\"We\'re not trying to ban cars. We\'re trying to use seat belts and drunk driving laws to make it safer. That\'s the same approach that we need to use for gun violence as well,\" she said.\r\nIn recent years, such as 2019, more Americans died from firearms than automobile accidents, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\r\nCourts have sided with the people over public health in the pandemic as well as in the gun war. States are all over the map on both.\r\nSome Americans are still under relatively strict Covid restrictions. Others are in states that have no restrictions at all.\r\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, faced protests and an alleged kidnapping attempt in 2020 over earlier Covid restrictions. This month she wanted additional Covid vaccines to fight a hot spot in her state, in part, because she is unable to place new restrictions in her state because the state Supreme Court ruled them out of order.\r\nNow, denied extra vaccine by the White House, she\'s pushing personal responsibility instead, pushing for voluntary pauses on indoor dining, deferring to liberty.\r\nThe federal government has, arguably, barely tried to exert authority on Covid.\r\nFormer President Donald Trump disagreed with federal mandates like a requirement to wear masks in public places and pressured states to lift restrictions.\r\nBiden has chosen to let states make their own rules, avoiding a fight over his authority and instead making masks mandatory in federal buildings and on public transportation. While public health agencies have repeatedly warned not to let up, states -- led by Democrats and Republicans -- have moved to loosen mandates and restrictions. The people have their freedom, and with it has come the potential for a fourth Covid surge despite a remarkable vaccination effort.\r\nHonoring sacrifice\r\nWashington has long been focused on war and the sacrifice of servicemembers who pay the price for American ideals.\r\nA ceremony commemorated a new World War I memorial blocks from the White House Friday.\r\nEarlier in the week, Biden visited Arlington National Cemetery after announcing he\'d pull US troops from the country\'s longest active military conflict.\r\n\"War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multi-generational undertaking,\" he said. \"We were attacked. We went to war with clear goals. We achieved those objectives... And it\'s time to end the forever war,\" Biden said, announcing his decision to pull the remaining US troops from Afghanistan.\r\nThe gun war is already a much larger multi-generational undertaking if you place the start at Columbine in 1999 and consider Sandy Hook, Las Vegas and the Pulse Nightclub as major battles.\r\nThe toll of this war is horrible and there is no end in sight.\r\nEditor\'s Note: If you or a loved one have contemplated suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or text TALK to 741741.

Trump said that while leaving Afghanistan is \"a wonderful and positive thing to do,\" he had set a May 1 withdrawal deadline and added that \"we should keep as close to that schedule as possible.\"\r\n\"I wish Joe Biden wouldn\'t use September 11 as the date to withdraw our troops from Afghanistan, for two reasons. First, we can and should get out earlier. Nineteen years is enough, in fact, far too much and way too long,\" Trump said, adding: \"September 11 represents a very sad event and period for our Country and should remain a day of reflection and remembrance honoring those great souls we lost.\"\r\nTrump is the latest former commander in chief to weigh in on Biden\'s plan, with both former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama having spoken to Biden ahead of his announcement last week. Obama praised Biden\'s decision to end the nearly 20-year war, which has spanned all four administrations.\r\nTrump\'s statement earned a pointed rebuke from one of his fiercest allies, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who tweeted Sunday evening: \"I could not disagree more with former President Trump regarding his support for President Biden\'s withdrawal of all forces from Afghanistan against sound military advice.\"\r\n\"With all due respect to former President Trump, there is nothing \'wonderful\' or \'positive\' about allowing safe havens and sanctuary for terrorists to reemerge in Afghanistan or see Afghanistan be drawn back into another civil war,\" Graham, a noted foreign policy hawk, added.\r\nBiden said the withdrawal of American troops will begin on May 1, in line with the agreement the Trump administration made with the Taliban. Some US troops will remain to protect American diplomats, though officials have declined to provide a precise number.\r\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani told CNN\'s Fareed Zakaria in an exclusive interview on \"GPS\" on Sunday that he supports Biden\'s decision to pull US troops out of the country, saying the move \"radically changes\" the context of the situation in the country, the region and the Islamic world. He added that his \"entire energy\" is now focused on working in that new context.\r\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan insisted earlier Sunday that US objectives had been achieved in Afghanistan, though he stopped short of saying the US \"won\" the war there. Instead, he told CNN\'s Dana Bash on \"State of the Union\" that the US must now focus on the battles of the \"next 20 years\" rather than the last 20.\r\n\"The terrorist threat has changed dramatically over the last 20 years,\" he said, citing the spread of al Qaeda to Syria, Yemen, Somalia and ISIS in Iraq.\r\n\"Against that dispersed and distributed terrorist threat, we need to allocate resources in a way that allows us to protect the homeland against a variety of threats from a variety of countries and continents, not just Afghanistan.\"\r\nThis story has been updated with comments from Sen.

On Monday, April 5, he headed from the United Arab Emirates to India for four days of consultations there. That Friday, he hopped to Bangladesh for six hours of meetings before returning to Delhi that night to catch a 14-hour flight home.\r\nLanding in Newark at 4:15 a.m., that Saturday, Kerry opened his laptop in a waiting lounge and began phoning counterparts back in Asia. After reaching Washington at 9:45, he headed home for a shower and change of clothes before arriving at the White House to brief national security colleagues at noon.\r\nKerry is 77 years old.\r\n\"He\'s going full speed,\" says Daniel Feldman, Kerry\'s chief of staff in his role as President Joe Biden\'s envoy on climate issues. \"It\'s something he feels passionately about. He is single-minded ... on a mission.\"\r\nKerry spent the last few days back on the road, in China and South Korea, in a frenetic countdown before getting the first major gauge of his performance this week. On Thursday, Biden has invited 40 world leaders to an Earth Day virtual summit intended to reinvigorate US leadership on an issue former President Donald Trump disdained.\r\n\'This is not someone you give talking points to\'\r\nKerry brings decades of preparation to his role. He attended the 1992 summit in Rio de Janeiro that effectively kicked off political efforts to diminish the warming of the earth\'s atmosphere as a result of carbon emissions. (He connected there with Teresa Heinz, who he had previously met at an Earth Day rally, and they married three years later.)\r\nAs former President Barack Obama\'s secretary of state, Kerry helped forge the 2016 Paris agreement that Trump exited and Biden has now rejoined. That has brought Kerry back into negotiations with familiar international counterparts.\r\nPersistence has been the through-line of his public career since he first drew headlines a half-century ago as a decorated Vietnam veteran turned anti-war protester. Two decades after that, Kerry returned to Vietnam with his late Senate colleague John McCain to help pave the way to normalization of US-Vietnam relations.\r\nKerry came within 60,000 votes in Ohio of winning the presidency in 2004 against Republican incumbent George W. Bush. After that bitter disappointment, the State Department became his executive consolation prize in a second Obama term dominated by foreign policy initiatives.\r\nHis ties to the current administration run broad and deep. Kerry and Biden served together for 24 years in the Senate. When Biden became Obama\'s vice president, Kerry succeeded him as Foreign Relations Committee chairman.\r\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki was Iowa press secretary for his 2004 presidential campaign, and later his State Department spokeswoman. Current Secretary of State Antony Blinken was his Obama-era deputy. In talks with diplomatic counterparts, advisers say he defers to Blinken by avoiding links between climate commitments and US concessions on other issues.\r\n\"I don\'t think you could find a more perfect individual for the job,\" says Heather Zichal, who served on Kerry\'s Senate staff before becoming \"climate czar\" in the Obama White House. \"This is not someone you give talking points to. He understands where the levers are.\"\r\nBig ambitions and challenges ahead\r\nBiden plans to announce more ambitious US climate goals in conjunction with this week\'s summit. Policy experts expect a pledge to cut carbon emissions around 50% from 2005 levels by 2030 -- a near doubling of the original US target. More than 300 business leaders last week embraced reductions of that scale in a public letter.\r\nWhether Kerry can persuade other nations the US will achieve it is another question. By renouncing the Paris agreement and scuttling key Obama climate regulations, Trump underscored the precarious nature of American political resolve in a starkly polarized era.\r\nAnd as Kerry knows too well, even presidents committed to climate action struggle in Congress against fears of economic fallout. In Obama\'s first term, Kerry tried to craft a Senate bill creating a \"cap-and-trade\" system of limiting carbon emissions. He failed.\r\nAdjusting to previous setbacks, Biden has eschewed either capping or taxing carbon emissions as a means of harnessing market forces. Instead, the new President has asked Congress for massive spending on clean energy initiatives to tackle climate change and create high-paying jobs at the same time.\r\n\"He\'s transformed an argument about constraint to an argument about opportunity,\" says John Podesta, another top climate adviser to Obama. Using presidential authority, Biden has also directed agencies to take steps against climate change across the executive branch.\r\nThe global outlook Kerry confronts, just over six months before a global climate summit in Glasgow, is as uncertain as the fate of Biden\'s proposals on Capitol Hill. While the likes of Britain and the European Union have embraced aggressive new emissions-reduction targets, fast-growing behemoths China and India have not. In a joint statement over the weekend following Kerry\'s visit to Shanghai, China joined the US in endorsing cooperation on \"enhanced climate actions.\"\r\nAdvanced economies have lagged in delivering promised financial aid to help developing countries shift to clean energy. Extreme weather events dramatize the urgency of climate experts\' calls to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century.\r\n\"COVID-19 resulted in a 7% drop in global emissions in 2020 because all economies shut down,\" Renee Cho of Columbia University\'s Earth Institute wrote recently. \"To keep warming below 1.5 degrees, we would have to keep cutting emissions by an additional 7% every year for the next decade.\"\r\nKerry, in what is likely his final government role, won\'t concede it can\'t be done.\r\n\"You have to have a little bit of optimism in this business,\" he told CNN\'s Jim Sciutto last week, \"or you can\'t get up\" every day.', 'John Harwood', '2021-04-19 16:32:53'),

The result is a Netflix drama that\'s impressive in its scope -- adding to the growing roster of dark comic-book tales -- but frustrating in its sluggish pacing, oscillating between twin timelines over the course of its eight initial episodes.', 'jupiter.jpg', 'Nicely cast, the series begins with a core of original-gangster superheroes, including the Superman-like The Utopian (Josh Duhamel), and their next-generation progeny, who are no slouches in the powers department. That includes Utopian\'s grown kids, one of whom, Brandon (Andrew Horton), has taken up the hero mantle, while his sister Chloe (Elena Kampouris) has rebelled against it.\r\nThe Utopian follows a heroic code -- he even chides his kids for foul language -- but things appear to be changing. Villains have become more ruthless, and a violent act against one of them actually yields a positive response from the public, forcing The Utopian to defend his boy-scout outlook.\r\nWho might be altering that dynamic, and pulling the unseen strings, dominates the contemporary storyline. But &amp;amp;quot;Jupiter\'s Legacy&amp;amp;quot; (adapted from graphic novels by Mark Millar and Frank Quitely) also leaps back to the Depression, explaining how the early heroes acquired their abilities through a series of flashbacks teased -- and teased and teased -- over the course of the season.\r\nAt times, the show pops dramatically, whether that\'s a terrific (and terrifically violent) superhero fight in the early going, the tumult surrounding the then-mortal Utopian/Sheldon\'s family business and the mysterious call that sets him on the path to his next chapter.\r\nStill, even by the standards of serialized dramas the writing inches forward grudgingly, while taking tiresome detours into the personal lives of Brandon and Chloe, whose angst-ridden relationships feel a bit too much like the stuff of a CW drama, just with more conspicuously exposed flesh and blood.\r\nThose subplots serve as a drag on the show, which makes the last half of the season feel like a letdown after its promising start. As a footnote, executive producer Steven S. DeKnight left midway through production, which might help explain some of the tonal inconsistencies.\r\nThe Netflix series also lands at a moment when the bar for such fare has been raised in the streaming space, even limiting the competition to revisionist, jaundiced views of superheroes, including Amazon\'s &amp;amp;quot;The Boys&amp;amp;quot; -- really the standard-setter in this subgenre -- and &amp;amp;quot;Invincible,&amp;amp;quot; as well as Netflix\'s &amp;amp;quot;The Umbrella Academy.&amp;amp;quot; That doesn\'t count Marvel\'s stepped-up if more traditional efforts for Disney+.\r\nOn the plus side, &amp;amp;quot;Jupiter\'s Legacy&amp;amp;quot; generally looks pretty dazzling and exhibits great visual flair in portraying its heroes, with Leslie Bibb and Ben Daniels as The Utopian\'s wife and brother, Lady Liberty and Brainwave, who also acquired powers on that strange journey and, like him, remain remarkably vital decades later.\r\nBased on where the season wraps up, the show is clearly playing the long game, perhaps rightly anticipating the audience that does buy into it to be willing to stick around for the long haul.\r\nWatching &amp;amp;quot;Jupiter\'s Legacy&amp;amp;quot; isn\'t a heavy lift. Yet even allowing for the fact that fleshing out the story works against moving faster than a speeding bullet, it would behoove all concerned to move a whole lot faster than this.\r\n&amp;amp;quot;Jupiter\'s Legacy&amp;amp;quot; premieres May 7 on Netflix.', 'Brian Lowry', '2021-05-07 22:36:54'),
